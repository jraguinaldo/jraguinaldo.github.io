			The Philippines was definitely known for its exposure of pride.
		This exposure is what most young people on social media want. This exposure even makes
		the most extrovert of extroverts jealous. This exposure is like having a really
		obvious sunburn. This exposure is like showing how much of a fraud they are. All
		I’m saying is, our pride is pretty big and publicly known like it’s not a secret.
		But this overexposure of pride is starting to go out of control. At this point,
		saying “I’m pinoy” to a foreigner is like saying “I’m good at everything”,
		all because of our overexposure of pride.</p>

			The pretense “Pinoys are good at everything” is just a silly
		cliche that should be stopped. Pinoys aren’t that smart and athletic other people may
		think. Pinoys aren’t “the solution to everything.” We are misinterpreted because of
		the filipino celebrities/influencers as an example of filipinos to international
		people. The celebrities/influencers do say “It’s really good to be born in the
		Philippines”, implying that they are indeed proud filipinos. So is it the celebrities’
		fault? No, no it is not. We filipinos don’t usually see the internationals’ point
		of view in our phrase ”It’s proud to be filipino”.</p></th>

			People that misinterpret our words might think that our pride is hubristic pride,
		which is an excessive confidence or arrogance in our pride. To the Filipinos’ eyes,
		the pride we see is an authentic one. To give an example, let’s use Manny Pacquiao’s
		victories. If Manny felt pride for his victory because of his hard work and training,
		that’s authentic pride. But if Manny felt pride because he was born a Filipino,
		that’s hubristic pride.</p></th>
